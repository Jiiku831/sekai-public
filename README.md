## Building

Install [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk): `npm install -g @bazel/bazelisk`.

## Setting up your profile

Edit the files in `data/profile` to set up your profile. The card
list `cards.csv` can be exported from [this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_pHFBUTILVJbBFymBY08pVbrLu6VmYfPDuQifQKD0dA/edit#gid=1249058281).

## Notes

*  You may consider setting up a private repo to save your profile. See the `sample_repo/` directory
   for example and instructions.
*  World link support is not added. You can run it and it probably will give a correct result but it
   may be slow.
